**Project summary**

The primary aims of this study were to address the issues with tracking microfauna swimming behavior (e.g., transparency, organism overlap, size) and to expand the adoption of behavior studies by other labs. We created a cost-effective, user-friendly pipeline for behavior analysis that uses the free software packages HitFilm and ToxTrac along with the R package “trajr” and used it to quantify the behavior of rotifers. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we treated rotifers (_Brachionus manjavacas_) with a mitochondrial enhancer (elamipretide) or inhibitor (rotenone) to alter swimming behavior via changes in mitochondrial efficiency and homeostasis.
This pipeline does not require coding to acquire tracking information (x, y coordinates) and all code used for post-processing is provided here to further aid in the usability of method. This protocol can be adapted for other microfaunal species that face similar issues with obtaining swimming behavioral measurements and can be used for experiments with limited funding.
